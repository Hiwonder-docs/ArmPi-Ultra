### 2.1.1 Introduction to Servo Control Node

* **Preparation**

(1) Assemble the robotic arm according to the tutorial stored in [1.ArmPi Ultra User Manual-> Accessories Installation and Notes](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#accessories-installation-and-notes).

(2) Start the robotic arm according to the tutorial saved in [2.ArmPi Ultra User Manual/3. Power-On Description](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#power-on-description).

(3) Access the robotic arm system desktop according to the tutorials locating in [ArmPi Ultra User Manual->1.6 Development Environment Setup and Configuration](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#development-environment-setup-and-configuration).

* **Initiate Servo Control Node**

(1) Click on <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image4.png" style="width:50px" /> to launch the command bar, enter the command, and press Enter to disable the auto-start service.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(2) Run the command to initiate the robotic arm SDK file.

```
ros2 launch sdk armpi_ultra.launch.py
```

(3) Open a new command terminal and enter the command to check the topics published after the robotic arm node has started. The bus_servo/set_position topic is used to control the servo movement.

```
ros2 topic list
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image7.png" style="width:500px" />

### 2.1.2 Servo Control Through Topic

* **Terminal Control**

Open a new terminal and enter the following command:

```
ros2 topic pub /ros_robot_controller/bus_servo/set_position ros_robot_controller_msgs/msg/ServosPosition '{"position": \[{"id": 1, "position": 300}\]}'
```

This command allows you to configure three parameters: servo_id: the servo ID, ranging from 1 to 6

position: the servo angle, ranging from 0 to 1000

In this example, the servo with ID 1 is set to rotate to position 300.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image8.png" style="width:500px" />

### 2.1.3 Initiate App Auto-Start Service

* **Control with Python File**

(1) In the terminal, enter the following command to launch the servo control node:

```
ros2 launch sdk armpi_ultra.launch.py
```

(2) Next, run the following command to start the feature. You will see the servo 4 of the robotic arm rotating back and forth between 200–500, while the terminal continuously prints out servo topic messages:

```
python3 ~/ros2_ws/src/example/example/simple/include/bus_servo_node.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image10.png" style="width:500px" />

* **Control with launch File**

(1) In the terminal window where the SDK file is running, press **Ctrl+C** to stop it.

(2) Then enter the following command to start the servo control. The launch file will call **bus_servo_node.py**:

```
ros2 launch example bus_servo.launch.py
```

(3) After starting, you will see the servo 4 of the robotic arm rotating back and forth between 200–500, and the terminal will print out servo topic messages.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image12.png" style="width:500px" />

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_srvs.srv import Trigger
from ros_robot_controller_msgs.msg import ServoPosition, ServosPosition
```

`ServoPosition`, `ServosPosition`: Custom ROS message types representing a single servo position and multiple servo positions. They are imported from the ros_robot_controller_msgs.msg package.

(2) ServoController Class

{lineno-start=10}

```
class ServoController(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('servo_control_demo')
        self.pub = self.create_publisher(ServosPosition, '/ros_robot_controller/bus_servo/set_position', 1)

        # Wait for the underlying robotic arm control service to start（等待机械臂底层控制服务启动）
        self.client = self.create_client(Trigger, '/ros_robot_controller/init_finish')
        self.client.wait_for_service()
```

Initialize the ROS node named servo_control_demo, create a servo position publisher with the topic /ros_robot_controller/bus_servo/set_position, and wait for the robot controller initialization service /ros_robot_controller/init_finish to become available to ensure that the underlying control is ready.

(3) set_servo_position Class

{lineno-start=19}

```
    def set_servo_position(self, duration, positions):
        msg = ServosPosition()
        msg.duration = float(duration)
        position_list = []
        for i in positions:
            position = ServoPosition()
            position.id = i[0]
            position.position = int(i[1])
            position_list.append(position)

        self.pub.publish(msg)
        for pos in position_list:
            self.get_logger().info(f'duration={msg.duration}, id={pos.id}, position={pos.position}')
```

Construct a servo position message of type ServosPosition, set the motion duration and the list of target positions. Iterate through the input position tuples, which contain the servo ID and the target position, and for each servo, create a ServoPosition message that includes the ID and position information. Publish the message to the servo control topic and log the duration, servo ID, and target position.

(4) main Function

{lineno-start=33}

```
def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    controller = ServoController()

    try:
        while rclpy.ok():
            controller.set_servo_position(0.5, ((4, 200),))  # Set servo ID 4 to position 200（设置舵机 ID 4 到位置 200）
            time.sleep(0.5)  # 等待 0.5 秒
            controller.set_servo_position(0.5, ((4, 500),))  # Set servo ID 4 to position 500（设置舵机 ID 4 到位置 500）
            time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for 0.5 seconds（等待 0.5 秒）
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        controller.destroy_node()  # Clean up the node（清理节点）
        rclpy.shutdown()  # Shut down ROS 2（关闭 ROS 2）
```

Main function initializes ROS 2 and creates an instance of the ServoController node. In a loop, it uses the set_servo_position method to alternate the movement of servo 4 between positions 200 and 500, pausing for 0.5 seconds each time. It handles keyboard interrupts (KeyboardInterrupt) by cleaning up the node and shutting down ROS 2.

    controller.set_buzzer(freq=1500, on_time=0.1, off_time=0.5, repeat=10)
    time.sleep(5)
    controller.destroy_node()  # Clean up the node（清理节点）
    rclpy.shutdown()  # Shut down ROS 2（关闭 ROS 2）
```

Initialize ROS 2 and create an instance of the BuzzerController node. Call the set_buzzer method to control the buzzer to operate with a frequency of 1500 Hz, sounding for 0.1 seconds and stopping for 0.5 seconds in each cycle, repeated 10 times. Wait for 5 seconds to ensure the buzzer completes the specified action, then clean up the node and shut down ROS 2.

## 2.4 PC Software Control

### 2.4.1 Introduction to PC Software

The host computer communicates with the microcontroller, sending commands to it and receiving feedback data in return. Typically, the host computer is a PC, where dedicated software, the PC software, is used to control the microcontroller.

<p id="anchor_2_4_4"></p>

### 2.4.4 Deviation Adjustment

During the robot's operation, if the servo shafts become misaligned due to replacement or other adjustments, calibration is required. There are two types of deviations to consider: **minor deviation** and **major deviation**. The calibration method varies depending on the situation.

* **Preparation**

(1) Assemble the robotic arm according to the tutorial stored in [1. ArmPi Ultra User Manual-> Accessories Installation and Notes](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#accessories-installation-and-notes).

(2) Start the robotic arm according to the tutorial saved in [1. ArmPi Ultra User Manual->1.3 Power-On Description](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#power-on-description).

(3) Access the robotic arm system desktop according to the tutorials locating in [1. ArmPi Ultra User Manual/6. Development Environment Setup and Configuration](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#development-environment-setup-and-configuration).

* **Determine Minor and Major Deviation**

(1) After remotely connecting to the robot, click the PC software icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image40.png" style="width:50px" /> on the system desktop.

(2) Switch the language to English via the voice option in the top-left corner. Then click "**Reset servo**" in the software to let the robotic arm stand upright.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image94.png" style="width:500px" />

(3) If after the servo reset, the main screws of servos 3 to 5 form a straight line as shown in the figure below, hereafter referred to as the center line.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image95.png" style="width:500px" />

(4) Servo 6 is parallel to the metal casing as shown in the figure:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image96.png" style="width:500px" />

(5) The metal casing above servo 2 is parallel to the camera casing, and the gripper at servo 1 is slightly open, then the robotic arm does not require deviation adjustment and this section can be skipped.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image97.png" style="width:500px" />

(6) If the angle between a servo and the center line is less than 30° and it can be corrected through the PC software, it is considered a minor deviation. You can adjust it following the [2.4.4 Deviation Adjudtment -> Minor Deviation Adjustment](#anchor_2_4_4_3) section in this document. For example, the deviation of servo 3 is shown below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image98.png" style="width:500px" />

> [!NOTE]
>
> The servo-to-center line angle is calculated as follows:
>
> The software slider range is 0–1000, while the servo's actual rotation range is 0–240 degrees. Therefore, each slider unit corresponds to 0.24 degrees (240 ÷ 1000).
>
> The adjustment range of the small slider is ±125, which corresponds to a minor deviation adjustment range of 125 × 0.24 = 30°.

(7) If the angle between a servo and the center line is greater than 30° and cannot be corrected even when the slider is set to its limit (±125), it is considered a major deviation, which should be corrected using the method in 4.4.4 Major Deviation Adjustment of this document. An example using servo 3 is shown below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image99.png" style="width:500px" />

<p id="anchor_2_4_4_3"></p>

* **Minor Deviation Adjustment**

(1) Open the PC software and click **Reset servo**. After the robotic arm returns to its neutral pose, click **Read deviation** to load the deviation data from the arm into the PC software.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image100.png" style="width:500px" />

(2) Taking servo ID 4 as an example, after reading the deviation, you can drag the slider under ID 4 in the PC software to adjust the deviation.

**Note that minor deviation can be adjusted directly by dragging the small servo deviation slider in the PC software.**

(3) Drag the small slider for servo 4 until the robotic arm forms a straight line. The values shown in the figure are for reference only, you shall adjust it according to the target and actual situation.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image101.png" style="width:500px" />

(4) Once satisfied, click **Download deviation** to save the adjusted deviation data back to the robotic arm.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image102.png" style="width:500px" />

* **Major Deviation Adjustment**

For major deviations, the servo must be removed from the U-shaped bracket, reset to central position, and then reinstalled. After installation, repeat the steps for minor deviation adjustment.

(1) Click "**Reset servo**" in the software to let the robotic arm stand upright.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image103.png" style="width:300px" />

(2) At this point, servo 2 may show a significant deviation exceeding 30°.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image104.png" style="width:500px" />

(4) **Power off** the robotic arm before proceeding with disassembly.

(5) Remove all screws from the main horn of servo 2 and the main shaft screw on the assistant horn. First remove the four screws around the horn, then the main shaft screw.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image105.png" style="width:500px" />

(6) Next, remove the U-shaped bracket.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image106.png" style="width:500px" />

(7) After removal, power on the robot, open the PC software, and click Reset servo. The central position of servo 3 is calibrated now.

> [!NOTE]
>
>Keep the disassembled parts safely. When the robot powers on, it may move to its initial pose, which could cause injury.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image103.png" style="width:300px" />

(8) Once the servo is reset, power off the robotic arm again and reinstall the corresponding main horn and assistant horn in a cross ("**+**") configuration.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image107.png" style="width:500px" />

Do not forcefully turn the servo shaft, and ensure the horns are properly aligned. If not, repeat the steps in [2.4.4 Deviation Adjustment ->Major Deviation Adjustment](#anchor_2_4_4_3) of this document.

(9) After installing the horns, align the U-shaped bracket with the holes on both horns and fasten the screws.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image108.png" style="width:500px" />

(10) Then, power on the device and repeat the steps in [2.4.4 Deviation Adjustment -> Minor Deviation Adjustment](#anchor_2_4_4_3) of this document to fine-tune the deviation.

## 2.5 Using the Servo Debugging Tool

When replacing a new servo, use the servo debugging tool to set the servo ID, central position, and other parameters. The ID numbering of servos can be found in the previous section [2.1.1 Introduction to Servo Control Node](#anchor_2_1_1).

**Important:** Before debugging, ensure **only one servo** is connected to the interface at a time. Connecting multiple servos in series will cause all servos to have the same parameters and prevent independent movement.

### 2.5.1 Servo Debugging Interface Overview

(1) Refer to the tutorial [1. ArmPi Ultra User Manual->1.6 Development Environment Setup and Configuration](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi-Ultra/en/latest/docs/1.ArmPi_Ultra_User_Manual.html#development-environment-setup-and-configuration) to establish a connection between the robot and the remote desktop tool.

(2) Open the terminal and enter the following commands:

```
cd ~/software/servo_tool/servo_tool
```

(3) After clicking "**OK**", make sure that only one servo is connected to the bus servo interface.

```
python3 main.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image111.png" style="width:500px" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image112.png" style="width:500px" />

(4) The interface is divided into two sections: ① Servo parameter settings area ② Servo parameter confirmation buttons. The functions are explained as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_2/media/image113.png" style="width:500px" />
